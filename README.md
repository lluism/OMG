Origin of Metals around Galaxies I: Metal-line doublet catalogs and parameter distributions


   This repository contains the metal-line doublet catalogs calculated in our paper 
OMG I (reference) for CIV, SiIV, MgII and NV, after searching all the quasar samples and 
removing repeated doublets. See the paper for details on the calculations. 


   Additionally, we include here the plots of the distributions of equivalent widths, redshift 
and significance of the detections (as in Figure 3 in the paper for the total catalog) for 
every quasar sample (KODIAQ DR1 and DR2, UVES, and HIRES).

The columns in the catalogs are set as follows:
1.  Quasar ID
2.  RA
3.  DEC
4.  Weighted-mean redshift of the doublet
5.  Equivalent width of the left-hand side line in the doublet
6.  Uncertainty in the equivalent width of the left-hand side line in the doublet
7.  Significance of the detection for the left-hand side line in the doublet
8.  Equivalent width of the right-hand side line in the doublet
9.  Uncertainty in the equivalent width of the right-hand side line in the doublet
10. Significance of the detection for the right-hand side line in the doublet
11. Quasar sample from where the doublet was obtained
