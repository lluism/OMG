Origin of Metals around Galaxies I: Metal-line doublet catalogs and parameter distributions


   This repository contains the metal-line doublet catalogs calculated in our paper 
OMG I (reference) for CIV, SiIV, MgII and NV, after including all the quasar samples and 
removing repeated doublets. See the paper for details on the calculations. 



   Additionally, we include here the plots of the distributions of equivalent widths, redshift 
and significance of the detections (as in Figure 3 in the paper for the total catalog) for 
every quasar sample (KODIAQ DR1 and DR2, UVES, and HIRES).
